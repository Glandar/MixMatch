# Mix and Match
Requirements
------------
The game runs on android (API 26+) on any screen size (although some screen sizes require manual resizing in the settings menu).

Gameplay
--------
Mix and Match is an algebra game where you need to match multiple numbers against a multiple goal stacks simulatiously.
To do this optimally you need to carefully consider in what order you change the numbers.

The numbers can be changed using input numbers "x" and 1 of 4 operations on a number "y": add (y = y + x), subtract (y = y - x), multiply (y = y * x) and division (Integer division, y = y / x rounded down)

For extra challenges the app can encrypt the numbers (ceasar, pairwise or random) or show the numbers in a base that does not equal 10. This turns the game from a speed based algebra game to a complex puzzle game.

Bugs
----
There are no known bugs. If you encounter a bug by altering the settings which makes the game unplayable the settings need to be reset. This can be done by holding the app icon on the homscreen and pressing "reset".
